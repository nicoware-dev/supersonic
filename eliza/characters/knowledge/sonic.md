Sonic is a high-performance Layer 1 blockchain that represents the evolution of the Fantom Opera network. All Ethereum smart contracts and tools can operate on Sonic with minimal modifications, making it fully compatible with the Ethereum ecosystem while providing significantly higher transaction speeds (up to 10,000 TPS) with sub-second finality.
Sonic achieves high performance through its optimized architecture and modern consensus mechanism. This architecture provides robust security while making transactions faster and more accessible for users. The platform can process up to 10,000 transactions per second with sub-second finality.
Sonic's protocol is designed specifically for user-friendliness and developer accessibility. The platform offers high throughput, provides a flexible development environment for builders, and includes comprehensive infrastructure tools for creating mass-market decentralized applications.
The Sonic validator system works through an advanced Proof-of-Stake model enhanced with DAG-based and ABFT elements. This hybrid approach minimizes forks and delays while bolstering security. Validators stake S tokens, aligning their interests with network performance.
Sonic's architecture is modern and efficient, designed for high performance. It includes SonicVM & SonicDB - optimized virtual machine and database layers that lower operational costs and reduce node synchronization times. The platform maintains full EVM compatibility while delivering enhanced performance.
Security on Sonic is maintained through a robust consensus mechanism and comprehensive security measures. The network implements advanced validator incentives and dynamic rewards, ensuring network stability and security. The system includes automatic safety measures - if verifiers detect any discrepancies, the entire mechanism pauses until the issue is resolved.
The S token serves as Sonic's native cryptocurrency, used for transaction fees and staking. The total supply at launch is approximately 3.175 billion S tokens, with a 1:1 upgrade ratio from FTM. The tokenomics include a 6% airdrop (~190 million S) and a dedicated developer funding pool (Innovator Fund).
The primary decentralized exchange on Sonic is Shadow Exchange. This DEX provides trading services, liquidity pools, and yield farming opportunities. It is a key component of Sonic's DeFi ecosystem, ensuring deep liquidity for traders.
Silo Finance serves as Sonic's primary lending protocol. It offers isolated markets for each token, providing secure lending opportunities with competitive APRs for lenders and flexible borrowing options through an integrated dashboard.
For developers building on Sonic, the network supports Solidity/Vyper smart contracts with minimal modifications. While maintaining broad compatibility with Ethereum, Sonic offers enhanced performance and efficiency. Comprehensive development resources are available through official documentation.
Sonic's RPC endpoints are accessible at sonic.drpc.org (HTTPS) and wss://sonic.drpc.org (WebSocket). The testnet (Blaze) is available at sonic-testnet.drpc.org. Developers can use standard Web3 libraries including ethers.js and web3.js for blockchain interactions.
Gas fees on Sonic are paid in S tokens. The network implements efficient gas optimization and transaction processing, ensuring cost-effective operations while maintaining network security. Users can monitor current gas prices through network explorers.
