# Deployment Options

Ready to get SuperSonic up and running? We've got several ways to deploy, depending on what works best for you. Let's walk through your options!

## Running Locally 🏠

- **On Your Own Machine**  
  Perfect for testing things out or getting familiar with the platform. Just follow our standard setup steps, and you'll be up and running in no time. It's also great for development and learning the ropes!

## Cloud Deployment ☁️

Want your SuperSonic instance running 24/7? Here are some cloud options we recommend:

- **DigitalOcean** 🌊  
  A budget-friendly choice that's easy to set up. Want to make things even smoother? Try using CapRover on DigitalOcean - it makes management a breeze!

- **Google Cloud Platform (GCP)** 🌐  
  Already using other Google services? GCP might be your best bet. It comes with lots of helpful tools built right in.

- **Amazon Web Services (AWS)** 📦  
  Perfect for production setups, especially if you're expecting heavy traffic. AWS gives you all the scalability you could need.

- **Railway** 🚂  
  Great for developers who want a simple deployment experience. It's particularly handy for smaller projects or when you're prototyping.

## Managing Your Setup

No matter which platform you pick, you'll use the same configuration tools we cover in our docs. Our modular design means you can make changes or add features without disrupting what's already working.
