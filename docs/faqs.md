# Frequently Asked Questions

Got questions? We're here to help! Here are the most common questions our community asks about SuperSonic.

## General Questions

### What exactly is SuperSonic?
SuperSonic is a Multi-Agent System (MAS) built specifically for the Sonic blockchain. Think of it as your AI-powered assistant that helps automate and streamline your DeFi operations, from token swaps to advanced market analytics.

### Is SuperSonic free to use?
Yes! We're proud to be open source and free for anyone to self-host. You'll only need to cover transaction fees (gas) on the Sonic network and any hosting costs if you choose to run it on a server.

### Where can I stay updated?
Jump into our Discord community, follow us on X (formerly Twitter), or keep an eye on our GitHub repository for the latest news and updates.

## Technical Stuff

### Do I need to be a coder to use SuperSonic?
While some basic familiarity with Node.js and TypeScript helps for self-hosting, don't worry! Our documentation walks you through every step of the setup process.

### How do I get started with SuperSonic?
It's pretty straightforward - clone our GitHub repo, install dependencies with `pnpm`, and you're on your way. Check out our [Developer Quick Start](#developer-quick-start) for the full walkthrough.

## Wallet & DeFi Questions

### Can I use multiple wallets?
Absolutely! Our Wallet Agent is built to handle multiple wallets. Just configure each one in your `.env` file, and you're good to go.

### Which tokens can I use?
Out of the box, we support Sonic's native token (S) and common tokens like USDT, USDC, and WETH. Want to add custom tokens? You can do that too by configuring the plugin.

### How secure are my private keys?
When you self-host SuperSonic, your private keys stay on your own server or machine. Just remember to follow security best practices - use secure environment variables and keep your server access locked down.

## Hosting & Costs

### Do I need a cloud server?
Not necessarily! While a cloud server is great for 24/7 availability, you can run SuperSonic on any machine that meets the basic requirements, including your local computer.

### What's the cost to host SuperSonic?
That depends on your setup. You'll need to cover your hosting costs (if using a server), API costs, plus any transaction fees on the Sonic network. The software itself is free!
