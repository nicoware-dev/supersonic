# Sonic Blockchain – Consolidated Documentation

This document merges and reorganizes comprehensive information about Sonic, covering its rebranding, tokenomics, technical architecture, consensus mechanism, ecosystem projects, developer tools, and top protocols on the network.

---

## 1. Overview and Rebranding

Sonic represents the next evolution of the Fantom Opera network. By optimizing performance and dramatically improving transaction speeds (up to 10,000 TPS) with sub‑second finality, Sonic positions itself as a high-performance, EVM‑compatible layer‑1 blockchain.

> “Sonic represents the culmination of over two and a half years of hard work by the technical team…”  
> – ([Sonic rebrand blog post](https://blog.soniclabs.com/from-fantom-to-sonic-what-you-need-to-know/))

### Key Highlights

- **Rebranding:** Fantom Opera → Sonic  
- **Speed & Throughput:** ~10,000 TPS with sub‑second finality  
- **EVM Compatibility:** Solidity/Vyper smart contracts with minimal changes  
- **Enhanced Incentives:** Developer fee monetization, airdrops, and more

---

## 2. The Sonic Token (S)

At the core of Sonic is its native token, **S**, which carries forward the legacy of Fantom’s FTM. S is used for:

- **Transaction Fees:** Paying for gas, enabling near‑instant, low‑cost transactions.  
- **Staking & Security:** Securing the network by staking tokens and earning rewards.  
- **Governance:** Allowing token holders to vote on protocol upgrades and ecosystem initiatives.

### Token Supply & Upgrades

- **Total Supply:** ~3.175 billion S tokens at launch  
- **Upgrade Ratio:** 1 FTM : 1 S  
- **Ecosystem Incentives:** 6% airdrop (~190 million S) and a dedicated developer funding pool (Innovator Fund)

## 3. Architecture and Technical Innovations

Sonic’s technical stack has been completely redesigned to meet modern scalability and efficiency demands:

### 3.1 High Performance

- **Throughput:** Capable of up to 10,000 transactions per second with sub‑second block finality.

### 3.2 EVM Compatibility

- **Seamless Migration:** Supports Solidity/Vyper contracts with minimal modifications, enabling smooth dApp migration from other EVM networks.

### 3.3 Enhanced Infrastructure

- **Sonic Gateway:**  
  A dedicated bridge for secure and efficient cross‑chain transfers between Sonic and Ethereum.
- **SonicVM & SonicDB:**  
  Optimized virtual machine and database layers that lower operational costs and reduce node synchronization times.
- **Modern PoS Consensus:**  
  Utilizes advanced validator incentives and dynamic rewards.

## 4. Consensus Mechanism & Additional Technical Details

Sonic’s consensus is built on a modern PoS model enhanced with DAG-based and ABFT elements:

- **Proof-of-Stake (PoS) with Advanced Validator Incentives:**  
  Validators stake S tokens, aligning their interests with network performance. Rewards are dynamically adjusted based on the proportion staked.
- **DAG-Based, ABFT Enhancements:**  
  This hybrid approach minimizes forks and delays while bolstering security.
- **Optimized Execution Stack:**  
  The combination of SonicVM and SonicDB ensures rapid smart contract execution and efficient storage.
