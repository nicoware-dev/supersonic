## Logo & Wordmarks

We have a few variations of our logo for different use cases. Keep it simple and clean—complex logos can be hard to parse at a glance.

- **Main Logo (Vertical Lockup):**  
  Placeholder for the main SuperSonic logo here.

- **Horizontal Logo:**  
  Placeholder for a horizontal variant (wordmark next to the icon).

- **Icon-Only Version:**  
  A standalone sonic-wave icon for use as favicons, profile pics, or when space is limited.

> **Tip:** Always ensure there’s enough clear space around the logo so it’s easily visible and not crowded by other design elements.

## Visual Elements

- **Sonic Wave Symbol:**  
  Use wave or speed-inspired patterns to represent our fast, interconnected AI agents.
- **Gradients & Overlays:**  
  Layer colors to create dynamic, futuristic effects.
- **Tech-Inspired Avatars:**  
  Use circular or wave-patterned frames for profile pics and icons.

**Examples of Usage:**
