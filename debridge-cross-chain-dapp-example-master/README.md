## debridge-cross-chain-dapp-example

A complete example of a conceptual cross-chain dApp which leverages the [deBridge protocol](https://debridge.finance) to send calls between its contracts across chains.

This example is built on top of the Hardhat framework and the [`hardhat-debridge` plugin](https://github.com/debridge-finance/hardhat-debridge). It will help you understand how to write, test, emulate and run EVM contracts that are intended to rely on deBridge infrastructure. Being a generic example, it may become the foundation for a limitless set of real world applications and protocols: object bridges, price feeds, automated cross-chain arbitraging services, and more. The sky is the limit!

### Introduction

Assume there is a `CrossChainCounter` contract residing on one chain. It stores a value that can be incremented by a call originating from another chain, and this call must be initiated by and only by the `CrossChainIncrementor` contract residing at the known trusted address.

### Contracts overview

`CrossChainCounter` is the contract representing receiver: it stores a value which is expected to be incremented by a call initiated by the trusted contract on another chain an broadcasted by the `deBridgeGate` contract. Thus, it expects the address of the `deBridgeGate` contract during deployment (you can find it at the [official docs](https://docs.debridge.finance/contracts/mainnet-addresses)).

`CrossChainIncrementor` is the contract representing sender: it is able to construct a message wit ha transaction call (a set of instructions to invoke `CrossChainCounter.receiveIncrementCommand()` with the given args) and pass it to the `deBridgeGate` with the intention to be broadcasted to another chain (where `CrossChainCounter` already resides) and be executed there. Thus, it expects:
- the address of the `deBridgeGate` contract on the same chain the contract is being deployed,
- the address of the `CrossChainCounter` contract on the destination chain,
- the chain ID of the destination chain where `CrossChainCounter` resides.

Additionally, `CrossChainCounter` only accepts calls originating from the trusted addresses, to it must be configured to whitelist the chain ID and the address where the `CrossChainCounter` contract resides. See `CrossChainIncrementor.addChainSupport()`.

### Tests overview

Tests are leveraging the [`hardhat-debridge` plugin](https://github.com/debridge-finance/hardhat-debridge).

`Basic.ts` is a simple test validating the normal flow: after the contracts are being deployed, the `CrossChainIncrementor` contract is being invoked to construct and pass the message to the gate; the emulator sends the message back to the gate; the gate executes the call which actually calls the `CrossChainCounter` with the args given in the message.

`Cases.ts` is a set of unit tests needed to validate edge cases and ensure security considerations are met: e.g., ensure that `CrossChainCounter` cannot by called by anyone but the gate, or that it rejects calls from untrusted addresses, etc.


### Tasks overview

This repository comes with a bunch of handy console commands to reproduce the aforementioned flow, either on the deBridge emulator (a part of `hardhat-debridge` plugin) or even on the mainnet chain. Available commands:
- `npx hardhat deploy-counter`
- `npx hardhat deploy-incrementor`
- `npx hardhat configure-incrementor`
- `npx hardhat configure-counter`
- `npx hardhat send-increment`
- `npx hardhat read-increment`

The best way to try them is to follow instructions from the `hardhat-debridge` plugin:
1. Run the hardhat node in the first terminal: `npx hardhat node`;
2. Run the emulator in the second terminal, attaching it to the hardhat node: `npx hardhat debridge-run-emulator --network localhost`;
3. Call these commands one by one against the hardhat node (`--network localhost`) in the third terminal.

#### Note on running against mainnet

Trying these contracts on the mainnet is almost the same: you can use the same commands or use any other method to deploy and configure the contracts.

It is important to remember that to finalize a cross-chain call (meaning that a broadcasted cross-chain message is being executed on the destination chain) a second transaction claiming the cross-chain message must be included to the destination chain. It can be done either:
- automatically by supplying extra amount of native currency of the origin chain as an `executionFee`, enough to cover the costs of including the transaction to the destination chain;
- manually on the [deExplorer](https://explorer.debridge.finance/), where you can find the proper cross-chain transaction by its `submissionId`;
- programmatically, fetching validators' signatures and properly constructing the transaction to claim the cross-chain message. This is out of scope of this document, however [this guide](https://docs.debridge.finance/build-with-debridge/getting-started) is a good starting point.
